function [gx,gy]=gaussgradient(IM,sigma)
%GAUSSGRADIENT Gradient using first order derivative of Gaussian.
%  [gx,gy]=gaussgradient(IM,sigma) outputs the gradient image gx and gy of
%  image IM using a 2-D Gaussian kernel. Sigma is the standard deviation of
%  this kernel along both directions.
