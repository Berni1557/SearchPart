%NIBLACK Adaptive thresholding
%
% t = niblack(im, k)
% t = niblack(im, k, w2)
%
% Returns t the per-pixel threshold, the binary image is
%   im > t
%
% The threshold at each pixel is a function of the mean and std
% deviation:
%   t = mean + k. std
% computed over a WxW window, where W=2*w2+1 and w2 defaults to 7.
%
% A common choice of k=-0.2
%
% The function optionally returns the per-pixel mean and standard
% deviation
%
% [t,M,S] = niblack(im, k)
%
% This is an efficient algorithm very well suited for binarizing
% text.  The window should be chosen to be of similar size to the
% characters.
