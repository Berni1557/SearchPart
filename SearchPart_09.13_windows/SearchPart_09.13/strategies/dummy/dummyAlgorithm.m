%dummy of your algorith
function [position,name]=dummyAlgorithm(image,scaleFactor,bar,SearchPartLibrary)

%Inputs:
%
% image -               image of the circuid board
%
% scaleFactor -         is the scale factor which gives you information about
%                       the size of the image (100 pixel~10mm) 
%
% bar -                 (optional) is an processbar object. Just place bar.update(); between your code to update the progress bar
%
% searchPartLibrary -   (optional) is a structure of maybe usefull
%                       algorithms for your code
%
%Outputs:
%
% position -            is an nx2 array of the positions of the parts where n is the numbers of parts
%
% name -                is a cell array of n strings with the name of the
%                       part or the value of the part (SI base units)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% paste your algorithm here! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


[Ir,~]=SearchPartLibrary.rotCorrection(image);                      % rotation correction is not necessary but probably usefull
% do some stuff
bar.update();                                                   % update progress bar
pause(5);                                                       % pause command is just to see what happends
position=[232, 914;830, 1710;1060, 320];                        % 3x2 array of part positions
