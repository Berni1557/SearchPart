function bw=adaptivethreshold(IM,ws,C,tm)
%ADAPTIVETHRESHOLD An adaptive thresholding algorithm that seperates the
%foreground from the background with nonuniform illumination.
%  bw=adaptivethreshold(IM,ws,C) outputs a binary image bw with the local 
%   threshold mean-C or median-C to the image IM.
%  ws is the local window size.
%  tm is 0 or 1, a switch between mean and median. tm=0 mean(default); tm=1 median.
