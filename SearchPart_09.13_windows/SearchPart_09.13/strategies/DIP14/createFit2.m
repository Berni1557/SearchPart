%CREATEFIT Create plot of data sets and fits
%   CREATEFIT(X1,Y1,W)
%   Creates a plot, similar to the plot in the main Curve Fitting Tool,
%   using the data that you provide as input.  You can
%   use this function with the same data you used with CFTOOL
%   or with different data.  You may want to edit the function to
%   customize the code and this help message.

%   Number of fits:  1

% Data from data set "y1 vs. x1 with w":
%     X = x1:
